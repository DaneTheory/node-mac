# node-mac

  This is a standalone module, originally designed for internal use in [NGN](http://github.com/coreybutler/NGN).
  However; it is capable of providing the same features for Node.JS scripts
  independently of NGN.

## Overview

This module helps create/manage native processes and event logs for Node.js applications on Mac OSX.

# WORK IN PROGRESS

I'm not quite ready to launch this.
